# Navigation

We'll start out by making a nav bar

- **Home**
- **Books**
- **Account**

And then we'll add a side nav bar, left of main, which will be responsive to the current nav page we are on.

## Home Section

- **Catalog** - Opens a list of books in the main area.
  - **Select-A-Book** - Opens book details.
    - **Go-Back** - Return to Catalog.
- **Order-A-Book** - Book order form.
  - **Order-Details** - Displays details of the submitted order.
    - **Go-Back** - Return to Order Page.

- **Available-Books**
- **Ordered-Books**
